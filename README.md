## Diabetes Prediction

This project concern predicting the diabetes in a patient using different Machine Learning approaches. The dataset comes 
from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) and original ones from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

I have used several ML algoritms ( Logistic regression, KNN and Decision tree) to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes.

Project is created with Python libraries:
* scikit-learn/pandas/numpy
